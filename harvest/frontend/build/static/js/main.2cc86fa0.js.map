Multiple search parameter names are separated by '&'. Search parameters\n\t * do not influence whether or not a URL is matched, but their values are passed through into\n\t * the matched parameters returned by [[UrlMatcher.exec]].\n\t *\n\t * - *Path parameters* are defined using curly brace placeholders (`/somepath/{param}`)\n\t * or colon placeholders (`/somePath/:param`).\n\t *\n\t * - *A parameter RegExp* may be defined for a param after a colon\n\t * (`/somePath/{param:[a-zA-Z0-9]+}`) in a curly brace placeholder.\n\t * The regexp must match for the url to be matched.\n\t * Should the regexp itself contain curly braces, they must be in matched pairs or escaped with a backslash.\n\t *\n\t * Note: a RegExp parameter will encode its value using either [[ParamTypes.path]] or [[ParamTypes.query]].\n\t *\n\t * - *Custom parameter types* may also be specified after a colon (`/somePath/{param:int}`) in curly brace parameters.\n\t *   See [[UrlMatcherFactory.type]] for more information.\n\t *\n\t * - *Catch-all parameters* are defined using an asterisk placeholder (`/somepath/*catchallparam`).\n\t *   A catch-all * parameter value will contain the remainder of the URL.\n\t *\n\t * ---\n\t *\n\t * Parameter names may contain only word characters (latin letters, digits, and underscore) and\n\t * must be unique within the pattern (across both path and search parameters).\n\t * A path parameter matches any number of characters other than '/'. For catch-all\n\t * placeholders the path parameter matches any number of characters.\n\t *\n\t * Examples:\n\t *\n\t * * `'/hello/'` - Matches only if the path is exactly '/hello/'. There is no special treatment for\n\t *   trailing slashes, and patterns have to match the entire path, not just a prefix.\n\t * * `'/user/:id'` - Matches '/user/bob' or '/user/1234!!!' or even '/user/' but not '/user' or\n\t *   '/user/bob/details'. The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.\n\t * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.\n\t * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.\n\t * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id\n\t *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.\n\t * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the\n\t *   path into the parameter 'path'.\n\t * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.\n\t * * `'/calendar/{start:date}'` - Matches \"/calendar/2014-11-12\" (because the pattern defined\n\t *   in the built-in  `date` ParamType matches `2014-11-12`) and provides a Date object in $stateParams.start\n\t *\n\t */\n\tvar UrlMatcher = (function () {\n\t    /**\n\t     * @param pattern The pattern to compile into a matcher.\n\t     * @param paramTypes The [[ParamTypes]] registry\n\t     * @param config  A configuration object\n\t     * - `caseInsensitive` - `true` if URL matching should be case insensitive, otherwise `false`, the default value (for backward compatibility) is `false`.\n\t     * - `strict` - `false` if matching against a URL with a trailing slash should be treated as equivalent to a URL without a trailing slash, the default value is `true`.\n\t     */\n\t    function UrlMatcher(pattern, paramTypes, paramFactory, config) {\n\t        var _this = this;\n\t        this.config = config;\n\t        /** @hidden */\n\t        this._cache = { path: [this], parent: null, pattern: null };\n\t        /** @hidden */\n\t        this._children = [];\n\t        /** @hidden */\n\t        this._params = [];\n\t        /** @hidden */\n\t        this._segments = [];\n\t        /** @hidden */\n\t        this._compiled = [];\n\t        this.pattern = pattern;\n\t        this.config = common_1.defaults(this.config, {\n\t            params: {},\n\t            strict: true,\n\t            caseInsensitive: false,\n\t            paramMap: common_1.identity\n\t        });\n\t        // Find all placeholders and create a compiled pattern, using either classic or curly syntax:\n\t        //   '*' name\n\t        //   ':' name\n\t        //   '{' name '}'\n\t        //   '{' name ':' regexp '}'\n\t        // The regular expression is somewhat complicated due to the need to allow curly braces\n\t        // inside the regular expression.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n\t   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n\t   *\n\t   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n\t   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n\t   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n\t   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n\t   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n\t   *\n\t   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n\t   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n\t   *\n\t   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n\t   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n\t   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n\t   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n\t   *\n\t   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n\t   *\n\t   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n\t   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n\t   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n\t   *\n\t   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n\t   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode.
